# Next.js + PostgreSQL Auth Starter

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) starter kit that uses [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) for simple email + password login, [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) as the ORM, and a [Neon Postgres](https://vercel.com/postgres) database to persist the data.

## Developing Locally

*Make sure you have a recent version of NodeJs and npm.*

1. Set your Environment Variables in a `.env` file
2. Run the dev server with:
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
